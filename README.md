# Yu-Gi-Oh! Card-Creator

Welcome to my Desktop Application "Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Creator". You will find features like the "Card Creator", "TCG List", or the "Character Index".

Follow the installation and try it out:

1. Clone this repository using "git clone".

2. Open the folder in your IDE (e.g.: VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.).

3. Run the Backend "YugiohbackendApplication".

4. To let the frontend work properly change your monitor resolution to "1280 x 720".

5. In the Terminal switch to the frontend folder by typing "cd yugiohcardcreator_frontend".

6. Run the application by typing "npm run dev"

7. Have fun!
